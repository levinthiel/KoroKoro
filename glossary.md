## Naming Conventions

For naming of **components**, we aim:

- for naming that reflects (at least one should apply):
  - the relation to the parent component
  - component structure
  - purpose of the component by using action verbs
- for names as descriptive as possible
- for not leaving out letters (e.g. vocals)
